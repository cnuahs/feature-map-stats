function [lambda, max_power] = fourier_wavelength(map)
%FOURIER_WAVELENGTH Calculate the average wavelength of a map.
%
% [lambda, max_power] = fourier_wavelength(map)
%
% Calculates the average wavelength, in pixels, of the given map. Calculated
% as the mean Fourier wavelength of the map averaged over all directions.
% The maximum Fourier power is also returned.

% Based on code originally written by Miguel A. Carreira-Perpinan.

% Input validation
